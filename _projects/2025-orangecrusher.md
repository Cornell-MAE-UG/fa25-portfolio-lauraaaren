As part of a mechanical design class project, we were asked to design the structure of the crusher levers arms based on a given CAD model of the stand and crush head of an orange crusher. In order to achieve a balance between the amount of juice squeezed out and the amount of force the user needs to put in, we put in effort to adjust the length of lever arm to make the process efficient. 


This is how we solved the problem:

Our group used a 3D printed orange crusher to crush actual orange and measure the minimum amount of force to extrude the orange juice. Then we calculated the length of the lever arms by assuming an average 20lbs force applied to the handle, considering the coupling of variables including linkage length, lever arm length, and angle of the linkage. 


This pdf below documents the testing and calculation of a 3D printed orange crusher in order to find the length of the lever arms that operates at best efficiency.

However, I noticed that the restictions of crusher head and stand still exists, where the embraced stand was not very stable and difficult to clean up, I redesigned the entire crusher to leave an open area at the bottom and apply a single backbone to make the structure more stable.
