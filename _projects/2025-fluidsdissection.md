This video depicts our understanding of the fluid dynamics inside a weed wacker. In this project, we dissected a weed wacker in order to understand how the mechanics inside works, and made an animation video to exhibit our understanding. 
In the group, we dissected the weed wacker while filming videos together, and I was in charge of reassembling the fluid machine to understand the structures and write the first script for the 4-stroke engine, valves, and carburetor. I also drew the animation in the intro and the exploded view for the entire engine, and recorded the voice over for the intro. 
Here's the link of the video we made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-2mskxOUhQ
