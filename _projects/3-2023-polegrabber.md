One of the mission of our drone is to be able to rest and grab onto a pole with determined diameter. In order to achieve this goal, I designed this pole grabber that has one half of the circle fixed to embrace the pole, and the other semicircle available to rotate and fully enclose the pole so that the drone can cling onto the pole. The rotatable semicircular part is achieved with a servo driven gear and the gear teeth on the semicircle.
