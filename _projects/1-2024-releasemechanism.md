In the CUAD quadcopter team, we planned to release a small aerodynamic race drone from a flying carrier drone in order to attempt the Genius World Record of the fastest flying race drone. To achieve this goal, the release mechanism that would allow the race drone to be dropped from the carrier is needed. In this project, I have designed this release mechanism with the inspiration of Scotch mechanism that successfully released the race drone in our test flight.

This pdf below documents the evolution of the Release Mechanism part from iterations of CAD design to 3D printed part.
