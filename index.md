My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am an undergraduate engineer in Cornell University, with high self-guided learning ability in interested fields (self-studied FEA software: COMSOL Multiphysics, Solid Edge FLOEFD; Modeling software: Onshape, Autodesk Fusion 360; fluid dynamics...), creativity in applying engineering mindset into other fields, and eagerness in developing new skills.
